Paying
for Aids
As the Government announces a 66 per cent
cut in its grant to the Terrence Higgins Trust,
SIMON WATNEY examines the state of UK
HIV/Aids funding
DEALLY, funding for HIV and Alds
would be directly based on the
most reliable, up to date statistics.
Changing HIV figures would pro-
vide the basis for general and target-
ed HIV prevention work, whilst chang.
Ing Aids figures would determine
planning for hospital and community-
based services, including the cost of
treatment drugs. Unfortunately how-
ever, the real current and future needs
of the epidemic continue to be
obscured by complex social, cultural
and political factors.
The British government has in fact
spent a very greal deal of money
indeed in the name of HIV/Aids work,
yet much if not most of this has been
wasted, as the result of bad research
and bad policies. Government funding
continues to be based on the hope.
lessly misguided approach which it
established in 1986, depicting every.
one in Britain as if we are all at equal
risk from HIV.
All along, the goal of preventing a
hypothetical epidemic resulting from
heterosexual transmission has been
given priority over the goal of slowing
and stopping the real epidemic, which
continues to have a disproportionate
impact amongst gay and bisexual men.
Nor, unfortunately, are Aids charities
necessarily immune to the same mis-
guided approach.
But in order to understand the cur
rent crisis in funding it is helpful to look
at the complex relationship between
the statutory and voluntary sectors.
Largely as a result of lobbying done
by gay men, the government since
1988 has provided substantial core.
funding to set up (or ""pump-prime"" as
the jargon goes) new organisations in
the voluntary sector, responding to the
emerging needs of the epidemic. It has
now been decided that such resources,
12
known as Section 64 funding, should
henceforth be restricted to a maximum
of £450,000 per annum, per organi
sation. The Terrence Higgins Trust's
annual grant will thus be cut from
£145,000 down to £150,000 over the
next three years. This is justified by the
government as a means to ""provide a
proper balance between [Aids] and
other pressing demands"", and to
release funds to open up new areas of
work.
However, the Department of Health
has also clearly stated that the new fis-
cal policy ""in no way represents a less-
ening of our commitment to HIV/Aids
in general"". ""In the same way,"" health
minister Baroness Cumberloge said.
""the maintenance of the grant to the
Terrence Higgins Trust at what is still
a comparatively high level, compared
with many other voluntary bodies, is,
and is intended to be, the cleares! pos-
sible demonstration of the value we
attach to the continuing work of the
Trust.""
Spending choices
This may at first sound all very well,
and even ""democratic"", until one stops
to ask oneself what other incurable
epidemics are currently rile in Britain?
Indeed, it is the very idea that the work
of the Terrence Higgins Trust can
somehow be compared to that of
other non HIV/Aids charities which is
so alarming, for it signals that the gov
ernment still has no real sense of the
scale of the emergency growing daily
in the wake of HIV amongst gay men
throughout Britain. Nor does it sug-
gest that the government fully appre-
ciates that with three quarters of all
UK HIV/Aids cases being in London,
It is unreasonable not to respond
financially where the need is demon.
strably greatest.
This is not an ""equal opportunity""
epidemic. The same quantities of fund-
ing are not needed for every social
constituency. For the foreseeable
future it will continue to be gay men
who make up the great majority of
cases, and who are at greatest risk. In
retrospect, one of the greatest
tragedies in the management of the
UK epidemic has been the way in
which central government has direct
ed vast sums of money to provide HIV
education and support services where
they are least needed, rather than
where they are most wanted.
For example, there are now some
230 full-time HIV co-ordinators work.
ing in local districts of the National
Health Service. One certainly hopes
that they have some impact in pre-
venting heterosexual transmission.
However, as Peter Scott, editor of the
National Aids Manual, points out, only
20 or so of these are working where
it actually matters most, in places
such as Brighton, Bristol, Manchester,
Glasgow, and of course London. Fur-
thermore, as Scott argues, it can be
very difficult to persuade district health
authorities to spend their money wise.
ly, or sometimes to spend it at all,
since this repeatedly involves battles
on a local basis between HIV co-ordi-
nators and their superiors in public
health and health promotion, for
whom Aids is frequently a low priori-
ty, and who tend to lack any sense
whatsoever of gay men as a social
constituency to which they might have
e professional responsibility.
Unfortunately it is often difficult or
even impossible for the larger region-
al health authorities to make sure that
the money they are obliged to hand on
to the districts is being appropriately
spent. Nor is it clear that as financial
cuts bite deeper into the NHS and local
government, that either health author-
ities or local authorities will be prepared
to ""purchase' services by contract from
the voluntary sector organisations with
greatest experience. Certainly it would
be most regrettable If district health
authorities, mostly themselves far away
from the metropolitan centres of the
epidemic amongst gay and bisexual
men, become able to define and con-
tro! HIV/Aids policies in the inner cities
because they hold the purse-strings
on which non-government Alds service
organisations such as THT will increas-
ingly depend.
Bluntly speaking, this means that if
districts won't purchase services far-
geted at gay men, those services will
have to rely on private sector funds if
they are to survive, let alone if they are
to be developed. I don't think these are
necessarily the government's inten
tions, but they are nonetheless the
most likely results of the present poli
cies. We'll end up with hundreds of
awful, moralistic, useless, so-called
'HIV education"" videos for heterosex-
ual teenagers, more boring posters at
the doctor's, and next to nothing being
done for gay men.
Collaboration
The government is currently send-
ing out somewhat confused and con-
tradictory signals about HIV/Aids poli.
cies and funding. Happily the Secretary
of State for Health was not stamped-
ed by the media Into implementing
impractical HIV testing policies for NHS
staff. After all, where would such poli-
cies end? Would there be calls for
teachers to be routinely and regularly
tested, or even Cabinet Ministers? Yet
Mrs Bottomley does not seem to grasp

Whilst the government is doubtless
only too glad to be able to off-load
potentially costly services onto the vol-
untary sector, the latest ""equal oppor
tunities"" approach to funding from the
Department of Health flies in the face
of epidemiological reality. The very
charities which lace the wholly pre-
diclable increase in Aids cases over
the coming few years are being pun
ished because their work does not con-
form to the government's dogmatic
""politically correct"" view of the nature
of the UK epidemic.
Whilst the government wishes to be
seen to prevent the possibility of an
epidemic amongst heterosexuals, it is
not prepared to address or combat the
actual epidemic, which is amongst gay
and bisexual men. As I've been
repeatedly arguing in this column and
elsewhere for more years than I some-
times care to remember, there is not
in fact one single epidemic going on at
all, but several different epidemics, with
GAY TIMES MAY 93
different time-scales, affecting differ-
ent social groups according to differ-
ent modes of HIV transmission, and
oach requiring different types of
response and funding. Nor is it espe
cially surprising that the government
is currently adjusting its HIV/Aids poli-
cies without consultation with the vol-
untary sector, since it originally allo-
cated funds in the first place without
any such consultation.
The real issue, as Peter Scott
insists, is 'how to deal with an epi-
demic cost-effectively, with necessar-
ily limited resources"". Clearly, efficient
services must be made available to
everyone living with HIV and Aids, and
this will involve local authorities in rela
tion to housing and benefits for exam-
ple, health authorities in relation to
treatment and care, and the voluntary
sector for further support provision.
The vital need to co-ordinate resources
from such disparate institutions can
only be achieved by central planning.

Bottomley:
Not

Similarly, prevention work requires
a coherent approach, which proceeds
from a recognition and respect of the
ways in which gay men's lives differ

less of gender or sexuality. Indeed, it
may well be the case that targeted.
community-based HIV prevention work
for gay men cannot realistically be
accommodated within the older Aids
service organisations, which were
mostly long since de-gayed.
Perhaps the very notion of charities
which attempt to undertake every
imaginable task is also out of date and
now fundamentally mistaken? Why for
example should we expect an organ.

problems facing people with HIV or
Aids to also lead the field in HIV pre-
vention, or ""general"" telephone coun-
selling for that matter? Hence the sig-
nificance of the recently launched Stop
Aids Project, which has resulted from
an unusually enlightened collaboration
between regional health authorities in
north London, whilst being ""housed"" in
the voluntary sector with both the Ter-
rence Higgins Trust and Gay Men
Fighting Aids. This is one example of
a pragmatic, regional response, with
proper planning and initial resourcing,
which proceeds from the recognition
that gay men have particular needs in
London as a whole. Yet it is chilling to
think that even today, nobody has ever
conducted a proper, rigorous needs.
assessment for gay men anywhere in
Britain, on the basis of which a prop-
or national Aids plan might be devel-
opod, with clear funding parameters.
Moral debate
In this respect, the question of who
pays for the Aids crisis constantly
returns us to the question of what the
Stato is actually for? This is not, I think,
a question of party politics. After all,
the Labour Party has consistently failed
to understand this epidemic, and in
Holland last year it was a socialist-fem-
inist who implemented cuts on pre-
vention work for gay men in a manner
which Mrs Bottomley must have
warmed to. In all of this, the debate we
need concerns the very principle of
State responsibility for citizens facing
an unprecedented emergency.
Sadly, It is plainly obvious that in
Britain, as in other countries, gay men
are not generally regarded as a fun-
damental social constituency within the
wider social formation. In funding as
elsewhere it seems that we are losing
the moral debate constructed around
HIV/Aids, and it is far from clear how
many people in power would agree
with Edward King's recent observation
that: ""At a time when it is increasingly
popular to search for complex expla
nations for continuing or increasing lev-
els of unsafe sexual behaviour among
gay and bisexual men the most obvi.
ous explanation - lack of continuing
education about safer sex - must not
be overlooked."" (BMJ, March 20th, p
792). Right now the most crucial ques-
tions concern who controls funding.
and how we can win the moral debate
about HIV/Aids. The two are not
unconnected.

Technology
Fax broadcast technology as backbone of phone tree.
Ultimately,
electronic mail will be more important than fax. But now and for some time to come,
most organizations will be familiar with fax and set up to receive it, but not ready for e-
mail. Therefore we should start now with fax broadcast, add optional e-mail ASAP, and
offer the choice of receiving alerts either way.
Fax broadcast allows you to send a fax once, from an ordinary fax machine or
from a computer, and have it delivered automatically to dozens, hundreds, or
thousands of fax machines. MCI Mail offers a fax broadcast service which appears very
economical probably less than the cost of sending on ordinary fax long distance,
and start-up costs are negligible. You maintain your own lists (in their equipment),
using their software on your IBM-compatible computer. For example, you could have
lists of organizations/volunteers by Congressional subcommittees, meaning that you
could send one fax which would automatically go to persons who lived in (or within
local calling distance of) members of the subcommittee and who were interested in the
issue at hand; these recipients would then pick up their phones and call their personal
lists of people willing to make the calls (or write) to their representatives. By keeping
your lists current (as people move, etc.), you could call a targeted national mobilization
and have calls start coming in to all the committee or subcommittee offices the same
day the action alert is composed and approved.
Note that the end recipients (who make the calls to their representatives) only
need to have a telephone - not a fax. The local organization or organizer who
activates them only needs to receive ordinary fax. Only the central organization(s) need
more technology - a personal computer and a person trained to use the fax-broadcast
system, including its list-maintenance software.
Electronic mail. E-mail is less expensive and more flexible than fax. In
addition, one of its greatest virtues is the doors it opens for working relationships with
thousands of allies in potentially friendly movements (such as the environment, civil
liberties, Latin America or other geographic areas, etc.) whom we might not otherwise
reach.
We should encourage e-mail in general, and offer it as an option for receiving
action alerts (where it not only will save money compared to fax, but encourage two-
way and multi-way communication). Also, e-mail is the best way to circulate drafts of
action alerts, for editing and sign-off by representatives of the different organizations
which are coordinating their alerts.
For more details on e-mail, see ""Electronic Mail for Political Mobilization,
Community Building"" in AIDS Treatment News #172, April 2, 1993.

General Comments.
1. Government Responsibility. Prevention programs do not, by-
and-large, fit well into the private sector. Thus, it is the
government's responsibility to take the lead in AIDS prevention.
2. Policy Chaos. Because of the lack of informed leadership at
the highest levels of National and State governments, specific
policy guidelines for existing local programs to follow are
frequently confused and often lacking. Moreover, the distractions
constantly emanating from extremists, including elected officials,
consume an inordinate amount of field staff time and clearly
injure program goals.
3. Advisory Committees. Expert advisory committees need to be
established at State and local levels. These committees need to
have responsibility and power to act on their recommendations.
Some way must be devised to convince political leaders that these
are necessary, must be of high quality scientifically, and will
shield them from many of the politically sensitive issues
surrounding AIDS.
4. Location of Effort. Because of variations in ethnic,
geographic and behaviroal characteristics of at-risk populations,
the ultimate workings of AIDS prevention must be at the local
(county/city/community) level.
5. Current Status. It must be realized that, even in a
relatively well funded area such as California, only a skeleton of
an acceptable AIDS prevention program exists in all but a few
areas. Major increases in local staffs are required to field true
AIDS prevention.
6. Prevention Consumed by Treatment. More and more time of AIDS
""prevention"" staff is being spent dealing with the social and the
personal upheaval caused by the occurrence of AIDS. This must be
factored in when planning AIDS prevention funding
7. Funding/Hiring Mechanisms. The current processes by which
government funds are obtained and allocated and ultimately spent
are unacceptably slow for fielding AIDS prevention programs.
Epidemiology/Surveillance
1. Case surveillance.
Investigations of AIDS cases in established
risk groups should be shortened using short forms and engaging the
help of hospital staff such as infection control nurses.
Surveillance personnel should then concentrate their
investigations on AIDS patients and HIV-infected people having

TITLE 22
(Register 5, No. 2-1-12-85)
(f) Infectious waste, except for sharps capable of puncturing or cutting, shall
be contained in double disposable plastic bags which are impervious to mois-
ture and have a strength sufficient to preclude ripping, tearing or bursting
under normal conditions of usage and of handling the waste-filled bags. Each
bag shall be constructed of material of sufficient single thickness strength to
pass the 165-gram dropped dart impact resistance test as prescribed by Stand-
ard D 1709-75 of the American Society for Testing and Materials and certified
by the bag manufacturer. The bags shall be securely tied so as to prevent
leakage or expulsion of solid or liquid wastes during storage, handling or trans-
port.
(g) Infectious sharps shall be contained for disposal in leakproof, rigid, punc-
ture-resistant containers such as cartons or metal cans which are taped closed
or tightly lidded to preclude loss of the contents.
(h) All bags used for containment and disposal of infectious waste shall be
red in color and conspicuously labeled with the words ""Infectious Waste"" or
with the international biohazard symbol and the word ""Biohazard"". Rigid con-
tainers of infectious sharps waste shall be labeled in the same way or placed and
secured in the disposable bags used for other infectious waste.
(i) Compactors or grinders shall not be used to process infectious waste until
after the waste has been rendered noninfectious. Infectious waste in bags or
other disposal containers shall not be subject to compaction by any compacting
device and shall not be placed for storage or transport in a portable or mobile
trash compactor.
(j) Infectious waste contained in disposable containers, as prescribed in sub-
sections (f), (g) and (h) of this section, shall be placed for storage or handling
in disposable or reusable pails, cartons, drums, dumpsters or portable bins. The
containment system shall be leakproof, have tight-fitting covers and be kept
clean and in good repair. The containers may be of any color and shall be
conspicuously labeled with the words ""Infectious Waste"", or with the interna-
tional biohazard symbol and the word ""Biohazard"", on the lid and on the sides
so as to be readily visible from any lateral direction when the container is
upright.
(k) Reusable containers for infectious waste shall be thoroughly washed and
decontaminated by a method approved by the local health officer or the De-
partment each time they are emptied, unless the surfaces of the containers have
been completely protected from contamination by disposable liners, bags or
other devices removed with the waste. Approved methods of decontamination
include, but are not limited to, agitation to remove visible soil combined with
one of the following procedures:
(1) Exposure to hot water of at least 82° C (180° F) for a minimum of 15
seconds.
(2) Exposure to chemical sanitizer by rinsing with or immersion in one of the
following for a minimum of 3 minutes:
(A) Hypochlorite solution (500 ppm available chlorine).
(B) Phenolic solution (500 ppm active agent).
(C) Iodoform solution (100 ppm available iodine).
(D) Quaternary ammonium solution (400 ppm active agent).
(1) Reusable pails, drums, dumpsters or bins used for containment of infec-
tious waste shall not be used for containment of waste to be disposed of as

To
Although there is no available vaccine or prophylactic therapy
for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), other effective prevention
modalities do exist for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
The major one is teaching humans how to adjust their behaviors to
mimimize the risk of further infections. Since the majority of HIV
infections are transmitted through consensual acts (sexual
intercourse and sharing of intravenous drug-using paraphenalia),
people have a choice whether they wish to risk infection. Given
this factor of choice, which can be influenced by risk reduction
programs, substantial reductions in HIV transmission can be
realized ().
Because HIV infection is not evenly distributed across any
country, but is instead concentrated in specific settings where

for funding them will melt away if and when the heterosexual epidemic fails to
materialise. By contrast, those organisations which are clearly providing valuable
services to those genuinely in need will be in the strongest position to argue for
continuing and increasing financial support in the future.
Unfortunately, nearly all AIDS organisations seem to be stuck in the dogmas of the
eighties, like soldiers lost in a jungle, still fighting a war decades after peace has been
declared. For example, the National AIDS Trust dismissed out of hand the latest
epidemiological report which questions the extent to which HIV will spread beyond
high risk groups, even before it had been published. The London Lighthouse
newsletter ignores the reality of the British epidemic by dwelling on the unconnected
fact that heterosexual transmission is the most common route of infection in other
countries. Lighthouse director Christopher Spence MBE seems most concerned that
the heterosexuals of the future may judge the extent to which gay men were willing
to provide HIV services for everyone, and will find us wanting. But after six years
during which AIDS organisations have indeed tended to provide targeted services for
everyone except gay and bisexual men, AIDS organisations must wake up to the fact
that it is gay men who are now doing the judging, and they who are being found
wanting.

Dear Pat;
We just want to thank the Foundation for their assistance on our postcard book
project, which is enclosed. The funds donated through your organization, the Levi
Strauss Foundation and private donations greatly reduced the costs of producing
this multi lingual education material. With a total of 8 Asian and Pacific Islander
languages included in this postcard book, we can broaden our efforts to reduce
risky sexual behavior among immigrant gay and bisexual men and their partners.
Wayne Blankenship has been very helpful in moving the process forward, and we
will now be coordinating a distribution process with him for a number of the books
to be used by the Foundation.
Thanks again!

The phrasebook project was conceived through the evaluations completed by
individuals participating in our risk reduction workshops over the past year. There
was consistent identification of a need for skills building in ""bringing up"" and
negotiating safer sex beyond the discussion and role plays offered in the workshop.
The concept was tested within three of the English workshops held during the
spring of 1991 by providing handouts of safer sex ""one liners"" to participants, and
soliciting suggestions form the groups to add on to the list. A similar exercise was
conducted with primarily Filipino, Japanese and Chinese speaking participants to
encourage the use of colloquialisms within each language. Comments are included
on focus
group forms attached.
Once the concept was developed into a prototype, a group of language
consultants from the gay Asian and Pacific Islander community was gathered to
review the ""safer sex one liners"" list, as well as potential scenarios where sex
encounters could occur. Each language group was asked to develop appropriate
phrases and scenarios in their own language focusing on creating original language
rather than translation. These phrases were then translated back into English. Eight
language consultant groups underwent this process. *
The text including indications of graphics was assembled, and circulated for
review by gay Asian and Pacific Islander organizations in Los Angeles, and New
York. The comments are submitted in this package. The text was then consolidated
into the format presented for AIDS Office review.
The agencies that have consulted on the project include the Asian/Pacific
Lesbian and Gays Inc, Los Angeles, the Gay Asian Pacific Men of New York, and the
South Asian Lesbians and Gays, also from New York.
