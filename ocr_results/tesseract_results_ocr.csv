As the Government announces a 66 per cent
cut in its grant to the Terrence Higgins Trust,
SIMON WATNEY examines the state of UK
HIV/Aids funding

DEALLY, funding for HIV and Alds

would be directly based on the

most reliable, up to date statistics

Changing HIV figures would pro-
vide the basis {or genoral and target-
ed HIV prevention work, whilst chang:
ing Aids figures would dotermine
planning for hospital and community-
based services, including the cost of
tieatinent diugs. Unfortunataly how-
evel, the real current and {ulure needs
of the epidemic continue to be
obscured by complex social, cultural
and political factors.

The British government has tn fact
spent a very greal deal of money
indeed in the name of HIV/Alds work,
yet much if not most of this has been
wasted, as the resull of bad research
and bad policies. Government {unding
continues to be based on the hope-
lessly inisguided approach which it
established in 1986, depicting every-
one in Britain as if we ate all al equal
tisk fon HIV.

All along, the goal of preventing a
hypothetical epidemic resulting from
heterosexual transmission has been
givens priotity over the goal of slowing
and stopping the real epidemic, which
continues to have a disproportionate
impact amongst gay and bisexual men,
Nor, unfortunately, are Aids charities
necessarily immune to the same mis-
guided approach.

But in order to understand the cur-
rent ctisis in funding it is helpful to look
at the complex relationship between
the statutory and voluntary sectors.

Laigely as a resull of lobbying done
by gay men, the government since
1986 has provided substantial core-
{unding to set up (or ""pump:-prime” as
the jargon goes) new organisations in
the voluntary sector, responding to the
omerging needs of the epidemic. It has
now been decided thal such resources,

12

known as Section 64 funding, should
henceforth be restricted to a maximum
of £450,000 por annum, per organi:
sation. The Terrence Higgins Trust's
annual grant will thus be cut from
£145,000 down to £150,000 over the
next three years. This is Justified by the
government as a means to ‘provide a
proper balance belween [Aids] end
other pressing demands"", and to
release {unde to opsn up new areas of
work.

However, the Department of Health
has also cloarly stated thal the new fis-
cal policy “in no way represents a less-
ening of our commitment fo HIV/Aids
in general’, “In the same way,"" health
minister Baroness Cumberlage said,
“the maintenance of the grant to the
Terrence Higgins Trust at what Is still
a comparalively high level, compared
with many other voluntary bodies, is,
and is intended {o be, the cleares! pos-
sible demonstration of the value we
attach fo the continuing work of the
Trust.”

Spending cholces

This may at fist sound all very wali,
and even ‘democratic’, until one stops
to ask onesall what other incurable
epidemics are currenlly rig In Britain?
Indeed, itis the vary idea that the work
of the Terrence Higgins Trust can
somehow be compared to that of
other non HIV/Alds charities which is
s0 glarming, {or it signa's thal the gov-
ernment still has no real sense of the
scale of the emergency growing daily
in the wake of HIV amongst gay men
throughout Brilaln. Nor dogs It sug-
gest thal the government fully appra-
ciales that wilh three quarters of all
UK HIV/Alds cases being in London,
i is urnteasonable nol to respond
financially where the need is damnon-

strably greatest.

This is nat an “equal opportunity”
epidemic. The sama quaniities of fund-
ing are not needed for every cocial
constituency. For the foreseeable
future it will continue to be gay men
who make up the great majorily of
cases, and who are al greatest risk. In
teliospect, ona of the greatest
tragedies in the management of the
UK epidemic hes been the way in
which cantral government has direct
ed vast sums of money to provide HIV
education and support services where
they are least needed, rather than
where they are mos! wanted.

For example, there are now some
2230 full-time HIV co-ordinators work-
Ing In local districts of the National
Health Service, One cartainly hopes
that they have some impact in pre-
venting heterosexyal transmission.
However, as Pater Scott, editor of the
National Aids Manual , points out, only
20 or so of these are working where
il actually matters most, in places
such as Brighton, Bristol, Manchester,
Glasgow, and of course London. Fur-
thormore, as Scott argues, il can be
very difficult to persuade distict health
authorities (0 spend their money wige-
ly, or sometimes to spand it at all,
since this repeatedly invalves battles
on a local basis between HIV co-ordi-
nators and their superiors In public
health and health promotion, for
whom Aids is frequently a low ptiori-
ty, and who tend to lack any sense
whatsoever of gay man ag 8 sociat
constituency to which they might have
€ profassional responsibility,

Unfortunately it is often difficult or
even impossible for the larger reaion-
al health autherities to make sure that
the money they ate obliged to hand on
lo the districts Is being approptiately
spent. Nor is if clear that as financial

cute bite deeper Into the WHS and focal
government, that either health author-
ities or focal authorities will be prepared
to ‘purchase’ sarvices by contract from
the voluntary sector organisations with
createst experiance. Certainly it would
be most regrettable It district health
authoritias, mostly themselves far away
from the metropolitan centres of the
epidemic amongel gay arid bisexual
men, become able to define and con-
tro! HIV/Aids policies tn the Inner cities
because they hold the purse-strinas
¢n which non-government Alds service
organisations such as THT will Inereas-
ingly depend,

Bluntly speaking, this means that if
districts won't purchase sorvices tar-
geted al gay man, those services will
have to rely on private sector funds if
they are to survive, let alone if they are
to be developed. I don't think these are
necessarily {he government's inten:
tions, but they are nonetheless the
most likely resulis of the present poli-
cies. We'll end up with hundrods of
awtul, moralistic, useless, so-called
‘HIV education” videos for helerosex-
val teenagers, nore boring posters at
the doctor's, and nex to nothing being
done for gay men.

Nis Bottornlgy does not seem to grasp
the urgent need to target resources.

Whilst the government Is doubtless
only too glad to be able to off-load
potentially costly services onto the vol-
untary sector, the latest “equal oppor-
{unities"" approach to funding from the
Department of Hoalth flies in the face
of epidemiological reality. The very
charities which face the wholly pre-
diclabla inci ease in Aids cases over
the coming few years are being pun
ished because thelt work does not con-
form to the government's dogmatic
“politically correct” view of the nature
af the UK epidemic,

Whilst the government wishes to be
seen {9 prevent the possibility of an
epidemic amongst heterosexuals, it is
not prepared to address or combat tho
actual enidemic, which is amongst! gay
and bisexual men. As I've been
repeatedly arguing in this column and
elsewhere for more years than | some-
times care to remember, there is not
in fact one single epidemic going on at
all, but several different epidemics, with

GAY TIMES MAY 93

  
 
 
 

dillerent time-scales, affecting differ-
ent social graups according to diller-
ent modes of HIV transmission, and
cach requiring different types of
response and funding, Nor is it espe-
cially surprising that the government
is currently adjusting its HIV/Aids poli-
cies without consultation with the vol-
unary sector, since It originally allo-
cated funds in the first place without
any such consultation.

The real Issue, as Peter Scott
insists, is ‘how to deal with an epi-
demic cost-effectively, with necessar-
ily limited tesources”.Clearly, efficient
services must be made avallable to
everyone living with HIV and Aids, and
this will involve local authorities in rela-
tion to housing and benefits for exam-
pla, health authorities in relation to
freatment and care, and the voluntary:
sector for further support provision.
The vital need to co-ordinale resources
from such disparate Institutions can
only be achieved by central planning

Similarly, prevention work requires
a coherent approach, which proceeds
from a recognition and respect of the
ways in which gay men’s lives differ
from those of most helerosexuais,
vather than from the delusion that
everyone is exactly the same, regard
less of gender or sexuality. Indeed. it
may well be the case that targeted,
community-based HIV prevention work
for gay men cannot realistically be
accommodated within the older Aids
service organisations, which were
mostly long since de-gayed.

Perhaps the very notion of charities
which attempt to undertake every
imaginable task is also out of date and
now fundamentally mistaken? Why for
example should we expect an organ-
isation which specialises in housing
problems facing people with HIV or
Aids {o also laad the field in HIV pre-
vention, or ""gangral” telaphone coun-
selling for that matter? Hence the sig-
nificance 6! the recently launched Stop

Aids Pioject, which has resulled trom
an unusually entightenod collaboration
between regional health authorities in
north London, Whilst boing ""housed in
tho voluntary sector with both the Ter-
tence Higgins Trust and Gay Men
Fighting Aids. This is ore example of
A pragmatic, regional response, with
Prope! planning and initial resourcing,
which proceeds from the recognition
thal gay men have parlicular needs in
London as a whole. Yel itis chilling to
think thal even today, nobody hat aver
conducted a proper, rigorous needs-
assessment for gay men anywhere in
Britain, on: the basis of which a prop-
ar national Aids plan might be daval-
oped, with clear funding parameters.

Moral debate

In this respect, the question of who
pays for the Aids crisis constantly
reluins us to the question of what the
State is actually for? This is not, [ think,
@ question ¢f party politics, After all,
the Labour Pay has consistently failed
to understand this epidemic, and In
Holland last year it was a socialist-fem-
inigt who implemented culs on pre-
vention work for gay men in a mannar
which Mrs Bottomley must have
warmed tc. In all of this, the debate we
need concems the very principle of
State responsibility for citizens facing
an unprecedented emergency.

Sadly, It is plainly obvious that In
Britain, as in other countries, gay men
ate not generally regarded as 2 fun-
damental social constituency within the
wider social formation. In funding as
elsewhere il seems that we are losing
the moral debate constructed around
HiViAids, and it is far from clear how
many poople in power would agree
with Edward King’s recent observation
that: “At a time when it is increasingly
popular fo search for complex eypla-
nations for continuing or increasing fev-
els of unsafe sexual behaviour among
gay and bisaxual men the most obvi-
ous explanation - lack of continuing
oducation about safer sex — must not
be overlooked.” (BMJ, March 20th, p
792). Right now the most crucial ques-

tions concen who controls funding,

and how we can win the mora! debate
aboul HIV/Aids. The two are not
unconnected,

Technology

Fax broadcast technology as backbone of phone tree. Ultimately,
electronic mail will be more important than fax. But now and for some time to come,
most organizations will be familiar with fax and set up to receive it, but not ready for e -
mail. Therefore we should start now with fax broadcast, add optional e-mail ASAP, and
offer the choice of receiving alerts either way.

Fax broadcast allows you to send a fax once, from an ordinary fax machine or
from a computer, and have it delivered automatically to dozens, hundreds, or
thousands of fax machines. MC! Mail offers a fax broadcast service which appears very
economical — probably less than the cost of sending on ordinary fax long distance,
and start-up costs are negligible. You maintain your own lists (in their equipment),
using their software on your IBM-compatible computer. For example, you could have
lists of organizations/volunteers by Congressional subcommittees, meaning that you
could send one fax which would automatically go to persons who lived in (or within
local calling distance of) members of the subcommittee and who were interested in the
issue at hand; these recipients would then pick up their phones and call their personal
lists of people willing to make the calls (or write) to their representatives. By keeping
your lists current (as people move, etc.), you could call a targeted national mobilization
and have calls start coming in to all the committee or subcommittee offices fhe same
day the action alert is composed and approved.

Note that the end recipients (who make the cails to their representatives) only
need to have a telephone — not a fax. The local organization or organizer who
activates them only needs to receive ordinary fax. Only the central organization(s) need
more technology — a personal computer and a person trained to use the fax-broadcast
system, including its list-maintenance software.

Electronic mail. E-mail is less expensive and more flexible than fax. In
addition, one of its greatest virtues is the doors it opens for working relationships with
thousands of allies in potentially friendly movements (such as the environment, civil
liberties, Latin America or other geographic areas, etc.) whom we might not otherwise
reach,

We should encourage e-mail in general, and offer it as an option for receiving
action alerts (where it not only will save money compared to fax, but encourage two -
way and multi-way communication). Also, e-mail is the best way to circulate drafts of
action alerts, for editing and sign-off by representatives of the different organizations
which are coordinating their alerts.

For more details on e-mail, see ""Electronic Mail for Political Mobilization,
Community Building"" in A/DS Treatment News #172, April 2, 1993.

General Comments.

1. Government Responsibility. Frevention pregrams da nota by-
and-larges fit well inte the private sector. Thus, it is the
gevernment*’s responsibility ta take the lead in AIDS prevention.

@. Policy Chaos. Because of the lack of informed leadership at
the highest levels of National and State gevernments, specific
policy guidelines for existing lecal pregrams te follow are
frequently cenfused and often lacking. Mereever, the distractions
constantly emanating from extremists, including elected officials,
consume an inordinate amount of field staff time and clearly
injure program gcals.

3. Advisory Cammittees. Expert advisory committees need ta be
established at State and local levels. These cammittees need ta
have responsibility and power to act on their recommendations.
Some way must be devised ta convince political leaders that these
are necessary, must be of high quality scientificallys and will
shield them fram many of the politically sensitive issues
surrcunding AIDS.

%. Lecatian of Effeart. Because af variations in ethnics
geographic and behavireal characteristics of at-risk populations,
the ultimate workings of AIDS prevention must be at the local
(county/city/cammunity) level.

S. Current Status. It must be realized that, even ina
relatively well funded area such as Californias only a skeleton of
an acceptable AIDS prevention program exists in all but a few
areas. Major increases in local staffs are required te field true
AIDS prevention.

6. Frevention Consumed by Treatment. More and more time of AIDS
""srevention"" staff is being spent dealing with the social and the
persemal upheaval caused by the occurrence of AIDS. This must be
factered in when planning AIDS prevention funding

7. Funding/Hiring Mechanisms. The current processes by which
gevernment funds are obtained and allocated and ultimately spent
are unacceptably slaw for fielding AIDS prevention pragrams.

Epidemiclogy/Surveillance

1. Case surveillance. Investigations of AIDS cases i
risk groups sheuld be shertened using short forme and
help ef hespital staff such as infection centrol nurse
Surveillance persennel sheuld then concentrate their

investigations on AIDS patients and HiV-infected people having.

Intreduction. Through the centuries human infectious diseases
have maintained their existence through transmission of their
Causative agents fram infected cer Enna te uninfected persans. Te
combat these diseases, prevention programs have attempted ta
interrupt this proecess and thus terminate, one-hy-one,s these
“chains of transmission"". Depending on the disease, varicus

prevention modalities have been used.

Altheugh there is no available vaccine or prophyulactic therapy

for human immunedeficiency virus (HIV), other effective prevention
medalities de exist for acquired immuncdeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
The major one is teaching humans how to adjust their behaviors te
mimimize the risk of further infections. Since the majority of HIV
infections are transmitted threugh censengual acts (sexual
intercourse and sharing of intravencus drug-using paraphenalia)s
peaple have a cheice whether they wish tea risk infection. Given
this factor af cheice, which can be influenced by risk reduction
pregrams, substantial reductions in HIV transmissian can be

realized (),

countrys but is instead cencentrated in specific settings where

for funding them will melt away if and when the heterosexual epidemic fails to
materialise. By contrast, those organisations which are clearly providing valuable
services to those genuinely in need will be in the strongest position to argue for
continuing and increasing financial support in the future.

Unfortunately, nearly all AIDS organisations seem to be stuck in the dogmas of the
eighties, like soldiers lost in a jungle, still fighting a war decades after peace has been
declared. For example, the National AIDS Trust dismissed out of hand the latest
epidemiological report which questions the extent to which HIV will spread beyond
high risk groups, even before it had been published. The London Lighthouse
newsletter ignores the reality of the British epidemic by dwelling on the unconnected
fact that heterosexual transmission is the most common route of infection in other
countries. Lighthouse director Christopher Spence MBE seems most concerned that
the heterosexuals of the future may judge the extent to which gay men were willing
to provide HIV services for everyone, and will find us wanting. But after six years
during which AIDS organisations have indeed tended to provide targeted services for
everyone except gay and bisexual men, AIDS organisations must wake up to the fact
that it is gay men who are now doing the Judging, and they who are being found
wanting.

Dear Pat;

We just want to thank the Foundation for their assistance on our postcard book
project, which is enclosed. The funds donated through your organization, the Levi
Strauss Foundation and private donations greatly reduced the costs of producing
this multi lingual education material. With a total of 8 Asian and Pacific Islander
languages included in this postcard book, we can broaden our efforts to reduce
risky sexual behavior among immigrant gay and bisexual men and their partners.

Wayne Blankenship has been very helpful in moving the process forward, and we
will now be coordinating a distribution process with him for a number of the books
to be used by the Foundation.

Thanks again!

The phrasebook project was conceived through the evaluations completed by
individuals participating in our risk reduction workshops over the past year. There
was consistent identification of a need for skills building in “bringing up” and
negotiating safer sex beyond the discussion and role plays offered in the workshop.

The concept was tested within three of the English workshops held during the
spring of 1991 by providing handouts of safer sex “one liners” to participants, and
soliciting suggestions form the groups to add on to the list. A similar exercise was
conducted with primarily Filipino, Japanese and Chinese speaking participants to
encourage the use of colloquialisms within each language. Comments are included
on focus group forms attached.

Once the concept was developed into a prototype, a group of language
consultants from the gay Asian and Pacific Islander community was gathered to
review the “safer sex one liners” list, as well as potential scenarios where sex
encounters could occur. Each language group was asked to develop appropriate
phrases and scenarios in their own language focusing on creating original language
rather than translation. These phrases were then translated back into English. Eight
language consultant groups underwent this process. +

The text including indications of graphics was assembled, and circulated for
review by gay Asian and Pacific Islander organizations in Los Angeles, and New
York. The comments are submitted in this package. The text was then consolidated
into the format presented for AIDS Office review.

The agencies that have consulted on the project include the Asian/Pacific
Lesbian and Gays Inc, Los Angeles, the Gay Asian Pacific Men of New York, and the
South Asian Lesbians and Gays, also from New York.
