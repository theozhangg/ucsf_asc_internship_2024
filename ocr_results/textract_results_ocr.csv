Technology
Fax broadcast technology as backbone of phone tree.
Ultimately,
electronic mail will be more important than fax. But now and for some time to come,
most organizations will be familiar with fax and set up to receive it, but not ready for e -
mail. Therefore we should start now with fax broadcast, add optional e-mail ASAP, and
offer the choice of receiving alerts either way.
Fax broadcast allows you to send a fax once, from an ordinary fax machine or
from a computer, and have it delivered automatically to dozens, hundreds, or
thousands of fax machines. MCI Mail offers a fax broadcast service which appears very
economical - probably less than the cost of sending on ordinary fax long distance,
and start-up costs are negligible. You maintain your own lists (in their equipment),
using their software on your IBM-compatible computer. For example, you could have
lists of organizations/volunteers by Congressional subcommittees, meaning that you
could send one fax which would automatically go to persons who lived in (or within
local calling distance of) members of the subcommittee and who were interested in the
issue at hand; these recipients would then pick up their phones and call their personal
lists of people willing to make the calls (or write) to their representatives. By keeping
your lists current (as people move, etc.), you could call a targeted national mobilization
and have calls start coming in to all the committee or subcommittee offices the same
day the action alert is composed and approved.
Note that the end recipients (who make the calls to their representatives)
only
need to have a telephone - not a fax. The local organization or organizer who
activates them only needs to receive ordinary fax. Only the central organization(s) need
more technology - a personal computer and a person trained to use the fax-broadcast
system, including its list-maintenance software.
Electronic mail. E-mail is less expensive and more flexible than fax. In
addition, one of its greatest virtues is the doors it opens for working relationships with
thousands of allies in potentially friendly movements (such as the environment, civil
liberties, Latin America or other geographic areas, etc.) whom we might not otherwise
reach.
We should encourage e-mail in general, and offer it as an option for receiving
action alerts (where it not only will save money compared to fax, but encourage two -
way and multi-way communication). Also, e-mail is the best way to circulate drafts of
action alerts, for editing and sign-off by representatives of the different organizations
which are coordinating their alerts.
For more details on e-mail, see ""Electronic Mail for Political Mobilization,
Community Building"" in AIDS Treatment News #172, April 2, 1993.
Politics
This isn't my area of expertise. But as an observer and a ""consumer"" of action
alerts, here is what I would like to see:
"
OCR_dataset/ucsf_mss2015-01_011_062/4.pdf,typed,"I, DONALD P. FRANCIS, declare as follows:
1. I am a physician licensed by the State of California and board certified in Pediatrics. I
received my M.D. from Northwestern University in 1968 and my D.Sc. (Doctor of Science) from
Harvard University in 1979.
2. I am the Centers for Disease Control AIDS Advisor to the California Department of Health
Services. My qualifications are detailed in my Curriculum Vitae which is attached hereto as
Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference. I make this declaration of my personal
knowledge and/or experience. For the last seven years, my professional career has specifically
dealt with and focused on AIDS and the AIDS virus. I have studied and am fully knowledgeable
about all past and current research studies and articles on AIDS and related subjects, especially
the transmission of the AIDS virus.
3. I have worked with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) since 1971 and have been involved
in the study and/or treatment of national and international infectious disease problems, including
the eradication of smallpox in Africa and the India subcontinent; the cholera epidemic in Africa
and the smallpox epidemic in Yugoslavia. I am presently a lecturer at the University of
California, at San Francisco Medical School and the University of California School of Public
Health on the subject of AIDS. I have worked in the AIDS field continously since 1981, and
coordinated all AIDS laboratory activity at CDC prior to my present employment.
4. I have published numerous articles and AIDS that have appeared in Science Magazine, the New
England Journal of Medicine, and the Journal of the American Medical Association. Among the
articles I have written are ""Human Retro Virus in Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome"" which
is published in a book entitled RNA Tumor Virus, Oncogenes, Human Cancer and AIDS, 1984;
""Evidence for HTLV-LAV Infection in Families in Children with AIDS"", Pediatric Infectious
Diseases, July 1985; ""Transfusion Associated AIDS"", New England Journal of Medicine, 1985;
""Natural History of Infection LAV-HTLV III"", Annals of Internal Medicine, 1985; ""HTLV-III in
Apparently Healthy Homosexual Men"", Annals of Internal Medicien, 1985; ""Prospects and
Pathways Toward a Vaccination for AIDS"", New England Journal of Medicine, 1985.
5. I served as Chairman of several sessions at both the First and Second International
Conferences on AIDS and servid on the program committee for both conferences.
6. There is a large study which is examining the transmission of the AIDS virus in families
containing infected children being conducted by the Centers for Disease Control. I discussed the
on-going results of that study with Dr. Harold Jaffe from CDC today and he informed me that
there has been no infection (as measured by antibody testing) of any family contact including
several that have been bitten by the infected child.
7. The recent report in Lancet of the child in Germany was investigated by Dr. Jaffe at CDC and
he informed me that the source of infection for the older child in the home of the infected young
child remains a mystery. There was a history of biting in that case but the role it played in
transmission is unknown, since the two children had multiple other types of household contact.
This case is of concern, since it may be the first case of household transmission. But it is
important to differentiate this situation, which involves a very young child, from a school
situation. Infants and very young children are a group for which the CDC recommendations are
purposefully vague, since the true risk of transmission from them and their contacts is not
known. From current information, their risk to others appears to be very low, but more
information is required.
I declare under penalty of purjury that the foregoing is true and correct under the laws of the
State of California.

General Comments.
1. Government Responsibility. Prevention programs do not, by-
land-large, fit well into the private sector. Thus, it is the
government's responsibility to take the lead in AIDS prevention.
2. Policy Chaos. Because of the lack of informed leadership at
the highest levels of National and State governments, specific
policy guidelines for existing local programs to follow are
frequently confused and often lacking. Moreover, the distractions
constantly emanating from extremists, including elected officials,
consume an inordinate amount of field staff time and clearly
injure program goals.
3. Advisory Committees. Expert advisory committees need to be
established at State and local levels. These committees need to
have responsibility and power to act on their recommendations.
Some way must be devised to convince political leaders that these
are necessary, must be of high quality scientifically, and will
shield them from many of the politically sensitive issues
surrounding AIDS.
4. Location of Effort. Because of variations in ethnic,
geographic and behaviroal characteristics of at-risk populations,
the ultimate workings of AIDS prevention must be at the local
(county/city/community) level.
5. Current Status. It must be realized that, even in a
relatively well funded area such as California, only a skeleton of
an acceptable AIDS prevention program exists in all but a few
areas. Major increases in local staffs are required to field true
AIDS prevention.
6. Prevention Consumed by Treatment. More and more time of AIDS
""prevention"" staff is being spent dealing with the social and the
personal upheaval caused by the occurrence of AIDS. This must be
factored in when planning AIDS prevention funding
7. Funding/Hiring Mechanisms. The current processes by which
government funds are obtained and allocated and ultimately spent
are unacceptably slow for fielding AIDS prevention programs.
Epidemiclogy/Surveillance
1. Case surveillance. Investigations of AIDS cases in established
risk groups should be shortened using short forms and engaging the
help of hospital staff such as infection control nurses.
Surveillance personnel should then concentrate their
investigations on AIDS patients and HIV-infected people having

under normal conditions of usage and of handling the waste-filled bags. Each
bag shall be constructed of material of sufficient single thickness strength to
pass the 165-gram dropped dart impact resistance test as prescribed by Stand-
and D 1709-75 of the American Society for Testing and Materials and certified
by the bag manufacturer. The bags shall be securely tied so as to prevent
leakage or expulsion of solid or liquid wastes during storage, handling or trans-
port.
(g) Infectious sharps shall be contained for disposal in leakproof, rigid, punc-
ture-resistant containers such as cartons or metal cans which are taped closed
or tightly lidded to preclude loss of the contents.
(h) All bags used for containment and disposal of infectious waste shall be
red in color and conspicuously labeled with the words ""Infectious Waste"" or
with the international biohazard symbol and the word ""Biohazard"". Rigid con-
tainers of infectious sharps waste shall be labeled in the same way or placed and
secured in the disposable bags used for other infectious waste.
(i) Compactors or grinders shall not be used to process infectious waste until
after the waste has been rendered noninfectious. Infectious waste in bags or
other disposal containers shall not be subject to compaction by any compacting
device and shall not be placed for storage or transport in a portable or mobile
trash compactor.
(j) Infectious waste contained in disposable containers, as prescribed in sub-
sections (f), (g) and (h) of this section, shall be placed for storage or handling
in disposable or reusable pails, cartons, drums, dumpsters or portable bins. The
containment system shall be leakproof, have tight-fitting covers and be kept
clean and in good repair. The containers may be of any color and shall be
conspicuously labeled with the words ""Infectious Waste"", or with the interna-
tional biohazard symbol and the word ""Biohazard"", on the lid and on the sides
so as to be readily visible from any lateral direction when the container is
upright.
(x) Reusable containers for infectious waste shall be thoroughly washed and
decontaminated by a method approved by the local health officer or the De-
partment each time they are emptied, unless the surfaces of the containers have
been completely protected from contamination by disposable liners, bags or
other devices removed with the waste. Approved methods of decontamination
include, but are not limited to, agitation to remove visible soil combined with
one of the following procedures:
(1) Exposure to hot water of at least 82° C (180° F) for a minimum of 15
seconds.
(2) Exposure to chemical sanitizer by rinsing with or immersion in one of the
following for a minimum of 3 minutes:
(A) Hypochlorite solution (500 ppm available chlorine).
(B) Phenolic solution (500 ppm active agent)
(C) Iodoform solution (100 ppm available iodine).
(D) Quaternary ammonium solution (400 ppm active agent).
(1) Reusable pails, drums, dumpsters or bins used for containment of infec-
tious waste shall not be used for containment of waste to be disposed of as
noninfectious waste or for other purposes except after being decontaminated
by procedures as described in part (k) of this section.

TARGETING AIDS PREVENTION EFFORTS TOWARDS HIV INFECTED PERSONS.
The concept of Prevention/Treatment Centers

Introduction. Through the centuries human infectious diseases
have maintained their existence through transmission of their
causative agents from infected persons to uninfected persons. To
combat these diseases, prevention programs have attempted to
interrupt this process and thus terminate, one-by-one, these
""chains of transmission"". Depending on the disease, various
prevention modalities have been used.
Although there is no available vaccine or prophyulactic therapy
for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), other effective prevention
modalities do exist for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
The major one is teaching humans how to adjust their behaviors to
mimimize the risk of further infections. Since the majority of HIV
infections are transmitted through consensual acts (sexual
intercourse and sharing of intravenous drug-using paraphenalia),
people have a choice whether they wish to risk infection. Given
this factor of choice, which can be influenced by risk reduction
programs, substantial reductions in HIV transmission can be
realized ().
Because HIV infection is not evenly distributed across any
country, but is instead concentrated in specific settings where

for funding them will melt away if and when the heterosexual epidemic fails to
materialise. By contrast, those organisations which are clearly providing valuable
services to those genuinely in need will be in the strongest position to argue for
continuing and increasing financial support in the future.
Unfortunately, nearly all AIDS organisations seem to be stuck in the dogmas of the
eighties, like soldiers lost in a jungle, still fighting a war decades after peace has been
declared. For example, the National AIDS Trust dismissed out of hand the latest
epidemiological report which questions the extent to which HIV will spread beyond
high risk groups, even before it had been published. The London Lighthouse
newsletter ignores the reality of the British epidemic by dwelling on the unconnected
fact that heterosexual transmission is the most common route of infection in other
countries. Lighthouse director Christopher Spence MBE seems most concerned that
the heterosexuals of the future may judge the extent to which gay men were willing
to provide HIV services for everyone, and will find us wanting. But after six years
during which AIDS organisations have indeed tended to provide targeted services for
everyone except gay and bisexual men, AIDS organisations must wake up to the fact
that it is gay men who are now doing the judging, and they who are being found
wanting.

The phrasebook project was conceived through the evaluations completed by
individuals participating in our risk reduction workshops over the past year. There
was consistent identification of a need for skills building in ""bringing up"" and
negotiating safer sex beyond the discussion and role plays offered in the workshop.
The concept was tested within three of the English workshops held during the
spring of 1991 by providing handouts of safer sex ""one liners"" to participants, and
soliciting suggestions form the groups to add on to the list. A similar exercise was
conducted with primarily Filipino, Japanese and Chinese speaking participants to
encourage the use of colloquialisms within each language. Comments are included
on focus group forms attached.
Once the concept was developed into a prototype, a group of language
consultants from the gay Asian and Pacific Islander community was gathered to
review the ""safer sex one liners"" list, as well as potential scenarios where sex
encounters could occur. Each language group was asked to develop appropriate
phrases and scenarios in their own language focusing on creating original language
rather than translation. These phrases were then translated back into English. Eight
language consultant groups underwent this process.
The text including indications of graphics was assembled, and circulated for
review by gay Asian and Pacific Islander organizations in Los Angeles, and New
York. The comments are submitted in this package. The text was then consolidated
into the format presented for AIDS Office review.
The agencies that have consulted on the project include the Asian/Pacific
Lesbian and Gays Inc, Los Angeles, the Gay Asian Pacific Men of New York, and the
South Asian Lesbians and Gays, also from New York.
The English versions of each story are written
in a vernacular that is close to the variations
of pigden English spoken among Japanese, Vietnamese
style in the English sections, thus the grammatical
Filipino native speakers We chose to utilize this
structure may not conform to Standard English .

""Unfortunately, we still do not have very good tests to
measure viral activity. The more we use the P24 test (a test for
a viral protein), the less reliable it seems to be. The beta-2-
