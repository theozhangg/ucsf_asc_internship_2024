This repository stores the final work for my UCSF Archives and Special Collections Data Science Internship that I completed Summer 2024. In this project, I examine the quality of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for handwritten documents versus typewritten documents and how they differ vastly; OCR for handwritten documents is notably inferior compared to that of typewritten documents. This in turn then creates biases and silences in datasets where handwritten documents are less accessible and are thus less utilized by researchers due to their lack of quality OCR. I analyze 3 different OCR tools to measure their performance for different types of documents, with the goal of finding one that can ultimately be used to unlock more handwritten data within the UCSF Archives and Special Collections. To further exemplify the need for usage of improved OCR tools within the library, I compare the difference in content between the types of documents to extract what value handwritten documents add to research as well as what silences are introduced when handwritten documents are not included in datasets. 

This internship was an incredibly rewarding experience, and I am extremely grateful to have been given the opportunity to conduct research and work with a fantastic team. My complete report has been uploaded to this repository and also [here](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6z8709hd), and you can also view my blog post for UCSF Library on their website (link to come).
